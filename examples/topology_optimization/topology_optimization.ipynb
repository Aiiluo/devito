    "### Topology Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a much more developed application of Devito. Here, we're going to be using Devito to solve some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization\">topology optimization</a> problems. These are the type of problems that Devito is well-suited for. Specifically, we'll be looking at an example that dolfin-adjoint looks at <a href=\"http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/documentation/poisson-topology/poisson-topology.html\">here</a>, and rewriting it with Devito. Their example originally comes from <a href=\"Topology optimization of heat conduction problems using the finite volume method\">Topology optimization of heat conduction problems using the finite volume method</a> by A. Gersborg-Hansen, M.P. Bends√∏e, and O. Sigmund, which we'll reference in this article as \"the paper\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take look at what we want to produce, so we know where we're headed and what to compare ourselves against. We'll take the first of the test problems from the paper. Although we can't show it up here in this notebook, a quick glance at the paper itself shows that the team produced dentrite-like shapes throughout the structure when the boundary conditions for the left and top sides have the condition\n",

    "$$ T = 0 $$\n",

    "and the bottom and right sides have the condition \n",

    "$$ (k\\Del T) \\dot \\textbf{n}=0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take the same conditions, and see if using the same equations, we can produce the same results by just working with Devito."
